He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer\r\n        handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the\r\n        known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it\r\n        somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.\r\n      \n\r\n        “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name\r\n        a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through\r\n        ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification of\r\n        the word, you deliver that which is not true.” —Hackluyt.\n\n\r\n        “WHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. hval. This animal is named from roundness or\r\n        rolling; for in Dan. hvalt is arched or vaulted.” —Webster’s\r\n        Dictionary.\n\n\r\n        “WHALE. * * * It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger.

(Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).\r\n      \n\r\n        It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a\r\n        poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans\r\n        and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to\r\n        whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane.\r\n        Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the\r\n        higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these\r\n        extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the\r\n        ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these\r\n        extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing\r\n        bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,\r\n        and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our\r\n        own.\r\n      \n\r\n        So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou\r\n        belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world\r\n        will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong;\r\n        but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;\r\n        and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes\r\n        and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness—Give\r\n        it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the\r\n        world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I\r\n        could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down\r\n        your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your\r\n        friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens,\r\n        and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael,\r\n        against your coming.
